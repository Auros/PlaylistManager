## Download (BETA)

To install, simply move the plugin dll to the Plugins folder of your Beat Saber install
BSML and SongCore are required for this mod, so please download the latest version from ModAssistant
The Beta release comes with a beta version of v1.3.0 for PlaylistLoaderLite which is **required** for this mod. This version may be incompatible with other mods that depend on PlaylistLoaderLite so please download this mod at your own discretion.

## Issues and Support
Since this is a beta, I haven't completed all features yet (look at the features section). If you have any suggestions for this mod that aren't already mentioned, you can contact me on Discord: PixelBoom#0001.
I also won't be able to provide support for now since this is a beta, if you encounter any issues file an Issue on GitHub and I'll fix it as soon as I can. But this mod is not complete and I haven't submitted it to beatmods or the BSMG discord for that reason so don't expect it to work flawlessly.

## Contribution
If you're a developer and would like to contribute to this mod, your contributions are welcome! Just submit a PR and I will take a look at it.
